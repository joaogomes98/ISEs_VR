# ISEs VR

## About
Project made for my thesis to obtain the MSc in Information Systems and Computer Engineering. In this project, VR and Unity were used to create an Immersive Speculative Enactment (ISE). In this enactment, we tested a hypothetical scenario where users talked to a hybrid audience (composed of local and remote attendees). The remote attendees were represented through virtual avatars, which could be seen by the speaker via AR smart glasses.
